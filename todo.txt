Select relevent features

 - Fix driver_last_3 avg and team_last_3 finish
 - add a column for pos gained/lost
 - add a column to figure out total overtakes 
 - add a column to figure out time lost in pits  - What exactly does pitloss mean?
 - add wind if possible

Add the most relevent features to predict something so that the user can see 

Things to add 
 - Tyre compound used
 - Grid vs quali diff (in case of penalties, can be neg or pos)
 - Team pit stop average time

 For rain:
 If you just want "wet race" vs "dry race", then is_wet_flag is the cleaner choice.
If you want to model in-race condition changes (e.g., pace drop mid-race), Rainfall as a time series is better.
